[2026-02-02 05:55:00] [DEBUG] Task: Fix MD025 in /Users/yangjie/Desktop/code/antigravity/docs/公文范本/公文范本_cleaned.md
Problem: Multiple H1 headers.
Plan:
1. Keep the first H1 (# 公文范本).
2. Demote all other H1 headers to H2.
3. Detect and remove "page header artifacts" (repeated section headers that interrupt flow).
Logic:
- Define known section headers (One to Nine).
- Track the current section being processed.
- If a known section header appears again while it is already the current section (and we haven't switched to another), treat it as an artifact and remove it.
- If a known section header appears and matches a differnet section, treat it as a new section start (keep and demote).
- Demote all other unknown H1s to H2 to ensure MD025 compliance.
Verification:
- Will run script and check file integrity.
